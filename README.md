# Open Any
Anytype Contributor's Community

## Templates
### `README_TEMPLATE.md`
Contains a template for the `README` file to be used in each public Anytype repository.

## Compliance
### `licenses-config.yaml` & `licenses-config.json`

Contains references for allowed and forbidden licenses. [SPDX](https://spdx.org/licenses/) short-form identifiers were used when possible.

Packages with licenses, that are not allowed and not forbidden, should be reviewed before using in `main` branches.
